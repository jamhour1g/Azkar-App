## Start with Azkar

Install the desktop app from the **[download page](https://jamhour1g.github.io/Azkar-App/download.html)**,
or browse [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jamhour1g/Azkar-App/releases).

For Linux repositories, update channels, and installation guidance, see the download page. For
release channels and packaging details, see the [release guide](docs/releasing.md).

## Made for a steady daily practice

- **Find the adhkar you need.** Explore the bundled collections, browse topics, or search for a passage.
- **Understand what you read.** Read Arabic alongside translations, with explanations and source references where available.
- **Pick up where you left off.** Recite a collection one passage at a time, track repetitions, and resume your progress later.
- **Build your own library.** Add remembrances, arrange collections, choose covers, organize tags, and keep favorites close.
- **Receive reminders from your library.** Choose collections or passages, set a cadence, and pause reminders when you need to focus.
- **Keep track of prayer times.** See today's schedule and the next-prayer countdown, with individual prayer alerts and location settings.
- **Read comfortably.** Use English or Arabic, right-to-left layout, light or dark themes, and adjustable text size and typeface.
