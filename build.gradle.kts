/*
 * The root project owns the sources that are shared by every module and therefore cannot live
 * inside any single one of them: release scripts and the log-capture helper in
 * `config/testing`, which `azkar-common` compiles into the test source set of all three modules.
 *
 * The formatting configuration is duplicated from that convention plugin rather than shared,
 * because Spotless refuses any target outside the project directory it is configured on: a module
 * cannot format `config/testing`, so the root project has to. Both sides rely on the repository
 * `.editorconfig` for the style itself (`ktlint_official`, 120 columns), so the two configurations
 * cannot drift in behaviour.
 *
 * `config/detekt` and `config/logback` are not listed here because they are XML, which Spotless
 * does not format.
