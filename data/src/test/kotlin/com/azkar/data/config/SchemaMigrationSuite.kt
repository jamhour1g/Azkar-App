/**
 * Migrating a database that has already been migrated.
 *
 * [TestDatabase.bootstrapWithH2] migrates a fresh in-memory database, which is what every other suite
 * uses. That path cannot fail here: there is nothing in the database yet, so every statement Exposed
 * generates is a `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` and there is no index for it to try to remove. The second
 * run is a different story — H2 has by then created indexes of its own to back the foreign keys, and
 * those are the case that has to keep working, because it is the case every start after the first
 * actually takes.
 *
 * This suite therefore opens a new pool and connection for every migration instead of sharing one,
 * which is what a process restart looks like to Exposed. That is why it does not share the
 * [TestDatabase] fixture: [TestDatabase.reset] assumes a connection it already holds.
