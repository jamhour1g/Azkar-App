/**
 * The wording a shipped shelf and a shipped label carry in every language the app ships.
 *
 * Two halves that fail in opposite ways. The catalogue half is checked before a database exists at
 * all: a catalogue entry and the tag vocabulary beside it are two hand-written tables that have to
 * agree, and nothing at runtime would ever notice when they stop — the shelf simply reads its
 * canonical English forever, which is the whole complaint this feature exists to fix.
 *
 * The seeded half is checked against a real database because that is the only place the wording is
 * actually observable: that the first launch of an empty database gives every shipped shelf and every
 * shipped label its rows, and that it gives nothing at all to a label somebody typed.
 *
 * The catalogue tests are deliberately pure. They are the cheapest thing here to run and the only ones
 * that catch a mistake before it has been written to a single row.
