/**
 * Creating a collection is the one write in the app that arrives as a single object carrying its
 * labels inline, and it is also the one write that goes out in two statements:
 * [ExposedCollectionRepository.save] writes the `collection` row and only
 * [ExposedCollectionRepository.setTags] writes the `collection_tag` rows behind it. That split is
 * invisible from the call site and therefore easy to break — it was broken, and a collection could
 * be created with labels that then went nowhere. These tests hold the seam shut: a collection
 * created with labels has to come back out of the database carrying those same labels, read back
 * through the same reader the shelf uses.
 *
 * The suite talks to a real H2 database rather than a repository double because the bug is a
 * SQL-shaped one. A double would have to restate `insert`'s column list to catch it, and a double
 * that drifts is the bug rather than the cure: `insert` grows a column, the double does not, and
 * the double keeps agreeing.
