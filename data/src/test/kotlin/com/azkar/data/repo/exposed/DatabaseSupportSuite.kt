/**
 * Behaviour of [guarded], the one function every repository method in this layer runs through, and
 * which therefore had no direct test of its own until now.
 *
 * A real driver failure is provoked rather than simulated. `ExposedSQLException` cannot be built
 * by hand — its constructor wants the `Transaction` and `StatementContext` list that Exposed
 * itself assembles — so a stand-in would have to be a mock of the very type under test, proving
 * only that `guarded` catches `ExposedSQLException` and nothing about whether Exposed raises one
 * for a statement that cannot run. Asking H2 for a table that is not there produces the genuine
 * article, driver cause and all.
