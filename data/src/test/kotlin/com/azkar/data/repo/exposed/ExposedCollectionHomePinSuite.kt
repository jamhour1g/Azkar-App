/**
 * What putting a collection on the Home screen does, and what it must not do.
 *
 * The rail is the one place in the app where a shipped collection and a user's own are treated
 * identically, so the rule that pinning is allowed on either kind deserves a test of its own rather
 * than being folded into the collection repository's suite. The three things worth pinning down:
 *
 *  - a shipped collection can be pinned, because being on Home says nothing about what is in it;
 *  - the stamp orders the rail, most recently pinned first, because that is what "the ones I added
 *    most recently" means;
 *  - pinning does not move `updated_at`, because a user who has not edited a collection should not
 *    see it jump to the top of the shelf's recently-updated ordering.
 *
 * And one thing worth pinning down that lives in the seed: re-seeding must not quietly undo a pin.
