/**
 * The two rules the tag service owns that the database only enforces.
 *
 * Everything else in this service is a pass-through, and pass-throughs earn their tests in the
 * adapter that does the real work — [com.azkar.data.repo.exposed.ExposedTagRepositorySuite] covers
 * the SQL. What is left is the part that has to hold no matter which database answers: two tags
 * cannot share a name, and the check has to happen *before* the write.
 *
 * A unique index catches the violation eventually, but only as a driver constraint exception, after
 * the transaction has already rolled back and carrying nothing that names the tag which collided.
 * Naming it is the difference between a dialog that can say which name is wrong and one that can
 * only report that the save failed.
 *
 * The fake below stands in for the database, so these tests are about ordering and nothing else. It
 * keeps just enough of a table to answer the lookups the service makes.
