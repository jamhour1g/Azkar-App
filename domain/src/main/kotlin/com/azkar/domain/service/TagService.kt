/**
 * The application's entry point for everything the UI does with tags.
 *
 * Mirrors [RemembranceService]: reads go straight through, writes are made atomic.
 *
 * The one place a tag write is checked before it is attempted. [rename] and [create] are the only
 * operations where the domain has a rule the database merely enforces — `tag.name` is unique, but
 * "somebody else already holds this name" is a statement about the user's edit, and by the time the
 * driver raises it there is nothing left to attach it to.
 *
 * "This name" is read wider than `tag.name`. A translated tag is known by two words, and a reader
 * typing the one on screen has to be stopped for the tag that already answers to it — otherwise the
 * translation buys nothing but a second tag called the same thing. See [findClash].

     * Renaming a tag onto the name it already has is not a conflict and succeeds: the lookup that
     * detects the clash ignores the tag being renamed, and returning early when the folded names match
     * means an editor the user opened and confirmed without typing is not reported as an error.

     * [findClash] gives. A rename that would make this tag answer to a word another tag already answers
     * to is refused, so the check has to cover what the tag is being *called* as well as what it is
