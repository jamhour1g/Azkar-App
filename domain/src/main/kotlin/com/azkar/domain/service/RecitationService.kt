/**
 * The application's entry point for recitation progress.
 *
 * Mirrors the other services — reads delegate straight to [recitations], writes are wrapped in
 * [transactions] — with two additions that are rules about the domain rather than about storage.
 *
 * A collection is required to exist before progress can be recorded against it. The membership table
 * already carries that as a foreign key, but a check here fails with a
 * [CollectionNotFoundException] that names the collection instead of a constraint violation that
 * names a constraint.
 *
 * Counts are clamped at zero rather than allowed to go negative. Progress that could be negative
 * would make the completion maths meaningless — a member with a count of minus three is neither
 * unfinished nor finished — so a stray undo is absorbed instead of being stored.
