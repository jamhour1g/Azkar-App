/**
 * The application's entry point for everything the UI does with collections.
 *
 * Mirrors the other services — reads delegate straight to [repository], writes are wrapped in
 * [transactions] — with one rule that used to be the whole point of the class and is now simply
 * absent: every collection is editable. A collection that shipped and one the user built hold the
 * same fields, accept the same changes and store membership the same way, so there is nothing left
 * to check before a write. [CollectionKind] survives as provenance for the badge and nothing more.
 *
 * What the class still earns its keep on is the no-op guards. Every toggle below reads the row and
 * skips the write when the row already says what was asked for, because a toggle that changes
 * nothing is not an edit and should not cost a transaction — and, more importantly, should not move
 * a timestamp that a later ordering reads.

     * things chosen up front — and the labels are written in a **second statement**, not left to
     * [repository.save].
     *
     * That second write is the whole reason this method is more than a call to `save`. `save` owns the
     * parent row and deliberately says nothing about labels, because a label is edited by picking one
     * rather than by filling in a form, and a full-aggregate write would turn every rename into a
     * silent membership edit. But a collection *being created* has no row to preserve that separation
     * for: it has never had any labels, so the only statement that can give it any is the one the
     * caller drives. Passing `tags` into the aggregate and trusting them to appear is the bug this
     * paragraph exists for — the aggregate carries them, `save` drops them on the floor, and the
     * collection reaches the shelf with none of the labels the user just picked, which looks exactly
     * like the app forgetting what they typed.
     *
     * The write is guarded on `tags` being non-empty so the ordinary case — a collection with no labels
     * at all — still costs one statement, and the aggregate is read back afterwards for the same reason
     * [duplicate] reads its copy back: the only thing that knows what the labels resolved to is the
     * storage that resolved them, so handing the caller an aggregate read before that would hand it an
     * empty set.
