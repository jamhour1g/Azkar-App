/*
 * Rebuilding helpers for [RemembranceCollection].
 *
 * Every one of these round-trips through [RemembranceCollectionImpl] so that trimming and blank
 * normalization run on the way out as well as on the way in, and they are written against the
 * interface rather than the implementation so that callers holding a loaded aggregate do not have
 * to cast to copy it.
 *
 * `updatedAt` is deliberately left untouched. The storage layer stamps it on write, because only
 * the storage layer knows what "now" was at the moment the row actually changed.
 *
 * Everything else is copied through, field by field, and the enumeration is deliberate: this helper
 * grew a field once and forgot it, and renaming a collection silently took it off the Home rail
 * because the timestamp went back to its `null` default on the way through. A list of what is *not*
 * rebuilt does not catch that; the only thing that does is a helper that refuses to have fields of
 * its own, so a new one cannot be left behind.

 * aggregate does not carry, because ordering is a storage concern and reading is what flattens it.
 * A caller that means to place a member has to say so through the membership repository instead of
 * quietly getting an appended one.
 *
 * Returns the receiver unchanged when [remembrance] is already a member. Membership is stored under

 * point worth defending: an earlier version of this listed `name`, `description` and `visibility`
