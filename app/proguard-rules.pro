# ProGuard rules for the release build. The compose desktop DSL runs this with
# shrink alone - no obfuscation (the app is open source, so renaming buys nothing
# and only breaks name lookups) and no optimization (it rewrote a LocalVariableTable
# entry in material3's SwitchDefaults into a malformed class that JDK 21+ rejects).
# So the job here is pruning dead library classes, notably the ~37MB of unused
# Material icons in material-icons-extended-desktop, while keeping the parts that
# are only ever reached by name.
#
# The Compose plugin injects its own defaults for compose/skiko; rules here cover
# what it cannot see. :app:collectProguardRules scans the runtime classpath for
# META-INF/services and generates a keep per provider into
# build/compose/proguard-generated.pro, minus the ones already held by a rule in
# this file or by the plugin defaults, so a dependency bump cannot silently drop
# one.

# ProGuard 7.8.0 reads Kotlin metadata up to version 2.3, while this project
# compiles with Kotlin 2.4, and reading the module file then fails the build,
# so let ProGuard skip it.

# anything loads the favourites, the hadith or the collection rail. The app's own
