/**
 * Colour preference, owned by the settings screen, ported from the `ColorScheme` scene property.
 *
 * [SYSTEM] is a real choice rather than only a launch default. The header's toggle could not offer
 * it — a lone glyph with no label, standing in for "whatever the desktop is doing", reads as nothing
 * — but a named option in a list of three has nowhere to hide, so following the OS is back.
 */
enum class ThemePreference { SYSTEM, LIGHT, DARK }

/**
 * Shell state holder, replacing `MainScreenController` + the scene-level theme listener.
 *
 * Kept out of the composable tree so a language switch recomposes only the content, and so the
 * library screen can be created lazily exactly like the original `libraryComponent` field.
 *
 * What lives here is only what the shell owns on its own behalf — the active language and the colour
 * preference. Which screen is on screen is *not*: that moved to the Navigation 3 back stack in
 * [AzkarNavigator], because an enum held exactly one destination and so had no way to express history
 * at all. Neither is whether the settings screen is open, which is [AzkarDestination.Settings] on that
 * stack for the same reason: it is navigation, not a boolean the shell has to keep in step with the
 * screen being drawn.
 *
 * [locale] is the app's single source of truth for the active language, provided to the tree through
 * `LocalUiLocale`. It starts from the JVM default because [LocaleStore.readAndActivate] has already
 * resolved the stored value into it before the window opens, and every later change is written to
 * both it and the JVM default — resources read the latter, everything else reads the former.
 *
 * [themePreference] follows the same shape for the same reason: it is seeded from the stored value
 * by [ThemePreferenceStore.read] and every change is handed to [persistTheme].
 *
 * Both persistence callbacks are required rather than defaulting to the real writes. They used to
 * default to `::persistThemePreference` and `::persistLocale`, which quietly meant "write to the
 * developer's own `settings.preferences_pb`" — a default no caller other than production could
 * survive. [rememberAzkarAppState] supplies them from the container, so the one place that knows
 * which store is in use is also the only place that names it.
