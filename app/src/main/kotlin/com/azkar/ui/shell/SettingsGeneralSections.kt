// `ui/shell/SettingsGeneralSections.kt` — the two blocks under General: the language the app speaks in,
// and whether it opens itself. Both used to sit among blocks about how the app looks, and start-on-login
// sat further still — inside the card headed "On screen & desktop notifications", under a heading about
// reminders, for a setting that has nothing to do with reminders at all. Neither is a visual preference,
// so neither is filed with the theme, and neither needs a reminder in order to be found.
//
// The whole of the language block, and of the startup row, is here; both were previously living in the
// files named for the *appearance* and *notifications* groups, which is how the page ended up grouped by
// which screen a setting had been written on rather than by what the setting is.

 * Wide enough for the longest endonym in the list beside its menu arrow without the arrow crowding the

/**
 * The language, as a dropdown on the block's own heading, with no card around it.
 *
 * This has been three shapes: a modal with a Save button, then a list of rows, then a card with one
 * row. Each version kept a container and the container kept costing the reader something. The modal
 * had an OK to dismiss and a modal to come back from, both for a setting people change once. The rows
 * drew the language as the only answer on the page that was not on the right-hand side, so it read as
 * content rather than as a setting. The card fixed that and then wrapped one word in 120dp of rounded
 * rectangle, under a block whose title had already said the word's job.
 *
 * What is left is the heading, the sentence under it, and the answer at the far end of the title's
 * line — which is the shape of a section that holds exactly one choice. Every other block on the page
 * needs a card because it holds rows; this one does not, and a reader who has to hunt for the control
 * inside a container pays for that container twice.
 *
 * It leads the page because it is the one setting here that changes the words everything else is written
 * in. Under [SettingsGroup.APPEARANCE] it would have meant scrolling past two blocks about pixels to
 * reach the answer to "why is this in the language it is in".
 *
 * The answer is named by its endonym via [displayNameIn] against the *active* locale rather than
 * translated, which is the one piece of self-description a language list can give that a localised label
 * cannot: "English" written in Arabic is a claim about the option, and "English" written in English is a
 * claim about the reader.
