// setting can belong to, the blocks those families hold, and the shapes every block is built from.
// Kept apart from the sections themselves so that adding a setting means writing a block, not
// learning a new layout language.
//
// The page is one long scroll rather than tabs, and that is what these pieces assume. The rail
// names every block under the family it belongs to, jumps to it, and highlights it as the reader
// scrolls, so nothing is more than one scroll's distance from anything else.

// The rail holds a 20-character label and an icon, so it needs far less than the content pane beside
// it, and a wider one would start competing with the cards it is meant to index.

 * The heading is the block's identity, which is why the title is lifted out of the cards. The cards
 * used to carry their own titles, so a card that needed saying what it was also had to repeat the
 * block it sat in, and the page read as a stack of same-sized boxes rather than as four things a
 * reader could name. Here the card is just a group of related rows and the heading above it does the
 * naming — which is also what lets the rail and the page agree on what a section is.
 *
 * The title and its sentence share a row with whatever [headingAction] supplies, so a control is
 * centred against the whole heading rather than against the title alone. Centring it against the title
 * alone is what an earlier version did, and it cost the heading its own line spacing: a 40dp control
 * is taller than an 11.sp title, so aligning their centres sank the title into the middle of the row
 * and left it hanging a good way above its own sentence.
 *
 * [headingAction] puts a control at the far end of the heading's line. It is
 * here for the one setting on this page that needs no card at all: the language. Wrapping it in a card
 * with a value row of its own meant a card whose only job was to hold a single word, and the word
 * itself said nothing the block's own title had not already said a line above it. Dropping the card
 * leaves the heading, the sentence about it, and the answer, and nothing between the question and the
 * answer but the reader's eye travelling sideways.
 *
 * [content] is optional because that same block has nothing left to put in one.
