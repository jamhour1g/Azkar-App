 * The app-level preferences.
 *
 * It is one scroll rather than a tab strip because a strip hides the shape of the page. The reminders
 * blocks together run several times the height of the language block, so "Notifications" read as a peer of
 * "Language" and gave no hint that choosing it was a longer scroll than the others — and a reader who
 * wanted only the prayer city had to open the last tab to find out. Stacked, the length *is* the
 * information: the reader sees that the reminder settings are the big ones before choosing anything.
 *
 * The rail is what replaces the strip's job. It names every block under the family it is filed in — the
 * four families partition the page, so a row's parent is always the answer to "what kind of setting is
 * this" — jumps to it, and marks the one the reader is inside, so the page still has a table of contents
 * without spending the top of the window on a few buttons that hide everything.
 *
 * State arrives rather than being held here. The theme and locale are already on [AzkarAppState] — they
 * have to be, since they outlive the window — and the notification and prayer values come from the same
 * [NotificationPreferencesRepository] the runtime reads, so this composable holds no field of its own
 * beyond the scroll position.

 * a page. Letting the block fill the pane it was given costs nothing at this size, because the text in

 * the list order and then quietly highlights the wrong row.
 *
 * The last block is the awkward one. [LazyListState.firstVisibleItemIndex] names the block at the top of
 * the viewport, and the final block is short enough — with the page's bottom padding under it — that the
 * list runs out of scroll before it ever reaches the top. So reading the topmost item gave the same
 * answer for the whole of the last screenful, and "Prayer times" could not be highlighted however far
 * down the reader went: the rail said they were still in the block above. `canScrollForward` is what
 * distinguishes that case, because it is false exactly when there is nothing below left to reach.
 *
 * [OFFSET_FOR_HEADER] is why this is not just `entries[index]`. The first item is the page header, not a
 * block, so the arithmetic would be off by one for the whole list — and off-by-one here does not crash,
 * it just marks the wrong row, which is the failure that would have shipped.
