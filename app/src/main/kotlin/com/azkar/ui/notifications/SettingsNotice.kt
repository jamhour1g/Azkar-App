/**
 * The two failures a settings editor can report, as separate sealed hierarchies rather than one.
 *
 * The screen these replace held a single nullable `String` and reused it for two unrelated jobs: a
 * rejected coordinate, and a failure to register Azkar with the desktop login manager. The startup
 * message therefore rendered at the bottom of the *prayer location* card, several sections away from
 * the switch that caused it, and cleared itself the next time a location was saved. The bug was not
 * the shared string so much as the shared slot — so each family now has its own type, and
 * [LocationNotice] cannot be passed to whatever renders a startup failure.
 *
 * Two types rather than one sealed interface with a `when` at the display site, because the display
 * sites are on different tabs: a location failure has nothing to say on the notifications tab, and a
 * startup failure has nothing to say on the prayer tab. Giving each a type means neither renderer
 * needs a fall-through branch for cases that cannot reach it.
 *
 * Cases carrying a [reason] keep the underlying exception's message for the times it is worth
 * showing; the fallback for each is a string resource resolved at the point of display, so this file
 * stays free of Compose resources.

 * at all. Re-seeding from storage after a write is what stops the fields drifting into showing
 * something that was never stored — without it a failed zone id stays on screen next to the error
 * that rejected it, and a successful save leaves the old value in the box.
