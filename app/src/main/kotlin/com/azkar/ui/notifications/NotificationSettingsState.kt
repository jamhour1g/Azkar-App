/**
 * Transient state for the notification and prayer settings that live on the settings screen.
 *
 * These used to sit on [ReminderManagerState] alongside the queue, because a single screen owned all
 * three sets of settings. They do not any more: prayer *times* are toggled from the home screen's
 * prayer card, and the location that calculator reads and the way a reminder is drawn over other
 * windows are both preferences rather than anything about a queue. So this class holds the four
 * location fields and the two presentations, and the queue's state holder no longer has to know what
 * a time zone is.
 *
 * Persisted values stay on [NotificationPreferencesRepository]'s `StateFlow`s and are read for drawing
 * with `collectAsState`; only the editable copies — the half-typed coordinates, the last failure —
 * live here. This class is the only writer, so every mutation goes through one `scope.launch` and one
 * repository call instead of being scattered across the body of a composable where a `LaunchedEffect`
 * could re-run it.
 *
 * Each of the two editors keeps its own notice type, so the prayer tab cannot render a startup
 * failure and the notifications tab cannot render a rejected coordinate. That is not cosmetic: the
 * two tabs are on different screens' worth of attention, and the old screen's single shared error
 * string put a login-manager complaint at the bottom of the prayer location card.
