 * Build the AWT toolkit here, on the main thread, so the window claims to be this application.

 * build the toolkit first: `sun.awt.X11.XToolkit` takes the last frame of its own stack trace,
 * turns the dots into hyphens and uses that as the application class. The toolkit is a
 * process-wide singleton, so whichever thread gets there first decides what every window of this
 * process calls itself, for the rest of the run.
 *
 * Left to itself that thread is a coroutine worker. The startup work suspends (the database
 * warm-up and the stores read), so AWT is first touched back on a `Dispatchers.Default` worker,
 * whose class name is `kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker` — and the window
 * then announced itself as `kotlinx-coroutines-scheduling-CoroutineScheduler$Worker`. No installed
 * `.desktop` entry says that, so the window manager could not tell the window apart from the
 * application it belongs to: the dock grew a second entry for it, under a Java icon and under
 * that class name, instead of showing the Azkar one.
 *
 * Doing it here fixes the name at the source. The body of a `suspend fun main` starts on the
 * calling thread, so the bottom frame is `com.azkar.MainKt`, the class becomes
 * `com-azkar-MainKt`, and that is exactly what the packager writes into the `.desktop` entry's
 * `StartupWMClass` — the two are derived from the same class name and cannot drift apart. The
 * toolkit is headless-only on a machine with no display, where there is no window to name, so the
 * failure is logged and ignored.
