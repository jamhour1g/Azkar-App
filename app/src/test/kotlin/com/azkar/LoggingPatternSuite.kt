/**
 * The shipped `logback.xml` pattern, checked against real events.
 *
 * A `ListAppender` can only prove a field reached the event; it says nothing about whether a human
 * would ever see it. The gap between those two is not hypothetical: `RemembranceMapper` declared a
 * `payload`, the field really was on the event, and the console still printed a bare sentence
 * because the pattern ended in `%msg%n`. So these tests *render* rather than inspect — they run the
 * production pattern over a captured event, which is the closest a test gets to a user's terminal.
 *
 * Only `:app` can run this: it is the module that packages `logback.xml`, so it is the only one
 * whose test classpath carries the file `renderAsProduction` reads the pattern out of.
 *
 * The capture hands out a logger of its own, and a logger created by name has no caller
 * information — so `%method` renders as `[?]` in the lines these tests assert on. Production loggers
 * use `KotlinLogging.logger {}`, which passes the callsite, and that is the only reason `%method`
 * is in the pattern at all.
