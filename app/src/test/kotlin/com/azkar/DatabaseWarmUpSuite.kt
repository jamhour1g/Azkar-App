/**
 * The window's database warm-up lifecycle: starts off the caller's thread, releases the pool when
 * it got far enough, and cancels itself when it did not.
 *
 * Everything runs on a `StandardTestDispatcher` over the virtual clock, so "the warm-up is still
 * in flight" is a state a test can put it in and hold, rather than something a real 180 ms wait
 * or a real H2 file would have to be raced against.
