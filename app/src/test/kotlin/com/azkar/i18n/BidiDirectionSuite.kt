/**
 * Which way a piece of user-typed text should be laid out.
 *
 * The centre of these is that non-Latin text has to come back right-to-left, because the one way this
 * can go quietly wrong is by testing only with English: a check written against Latin letters agrees
 * with every Latin test and with every empty field, and disagrees with every Arabic name in the app.
 * The scripts tested here are therefore the ones a single wrong constant would silently exclude —
 * Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac and Thaana all report right-to-left through *different* platform constants,
 * and a check that names only one of them passes the suite while leaving the other three laid out
 * backwards.
