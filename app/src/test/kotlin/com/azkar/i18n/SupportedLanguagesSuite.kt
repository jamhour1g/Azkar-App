 * The locale vocabulary the rest of the app is written against.

 * Two things here are load-bearing enough to pin. [Locale.isSameLanguageAs] is what stops a user
 * re-picking the language they are already on from rebuilding the tree, so its "language only, not
 * the region" rule is a deliberate decision rather than a shortcut. The language profiles also
 * supply layout direction and typeface choices, with English as the fallback for unsupported languages.
