/**
 * The stored language, and the rules that govern a stored value the app cannot honour.
 *
 * The theme store has the suite that caught a choice that never reached disk, and the language was
 * one store away from the same bug with none of the coverage: nothing here used to assert that
 * choosing Arabic survives the window closing, so a write that quietly went nowhere would have shipped
 * as "the language setting doesn't stick" with a green build.
 *
 * The round trip is asserted through a second reader over the same settings rather than through a
 * copy of a file. The question being asked is "does the choice come back?", and the in-memory store
 * answers it in full; whether a value survives a restart on disk is asked once, in
 * [com.azkar.settings.SettingsStoreSuite].
