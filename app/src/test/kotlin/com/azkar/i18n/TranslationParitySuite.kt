/**
 * The two language files agreeing with each other.
 *
 * Nothing else in the build can catch a key that exists in one language and not the other, or a
 * sentence whose `%1$d` is missing from the translation. The resource compiler resolves a key to a
 * *file*, so a key that is present in English and absent in Arabic is not an error anywhere — it is
 * an English sentence that quietly appears inside an Arabic screen, which is the exact symptom this
 * work was commissioned to remove. And a placeholder is not a key: `getString` binds arguments by
 * index, so an Arabic translation that drops `%1$d` renders a sentence with a hole where the number
 * was, with no diagnostic at all.
 *
 * So both files are parsed here as XML rather than as text, which is what lets the two kinds of
 * agreement be stated separately. A `<string>` must match exactly — same placeholders, same count.
 * A `<plurals>` must not, because Arabic has six quantities where English has two and legitimately
 * writes the number into fewer of them ("وسم واحد" carries it in the word). There the rule is that
 * English's placeholders all still appear, so no language loses the argument it was given.
 *
 * The files are found by walking up from the working directory rather than by a hard-coded relative
 * path, so the suite survives being run from the repository root as well as from the module.
