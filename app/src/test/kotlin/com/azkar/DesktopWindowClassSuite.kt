/**
 * The agreement between the running window and the desktop entry that ships it.
 *
 * A Linux desktop manager matches a window to its `.desktop` entry by comparing the entry's
 * `StartupWMClass` with the window's `WM_CLASS`. The two strings are computed independently:
 *
 * - Nucleus writes `StartupWMClass` by taking the packaged entry point's class name and
 *   replacing its dots with hyphens (`com.azkar.MainKt` becomes `com-azkar-MainKt`),
 * - AWT reports `WM_CLASS` from the class name of the bottom stack frame of whichever thread
 *   first constructed the AWT toolkit, with the same dots-to-hyphens substitution.
 *
 * When they drift apart nothing crashes. The app runs perfectly and the dock shows a generic
 * Java icon next to a label that is the raw `WM_CLASS`. That is not hypothetical: the toolkit was
 * first touched on a coroutine worker, so the dock used to read
 * `kotlinx-coroutines-scheduling-CoroutineScheduler$Worker`.
 *
 * `azkar.desktop.mainClass` is the value the build script hands the packager, so these
 * assertions run against the string the package will carry rather than a copy of it.
