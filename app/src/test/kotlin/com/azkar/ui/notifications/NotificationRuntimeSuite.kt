/**
 * That the scheduler announces what came due while it was running, and stays quiet about the rest.
 *
 * The bug these tests exist for was reported as: *a notification pops up exactly when the app is
 * opened for the first time after installing it.* The app draws one kind of notification — the
 * overlay card — and the scheduler produces it from exactly two paths: the shared reminder queue and
 * the prayer bells. Both of them were catch-up paths, and the scheduler's first poll runs the moment
 * the app opens, so anything that had come due while the app was closed was announced at the door.
 * On a fresh install there was nothing yet to have come due, which made the timing look like a
 * coincidence of the install rather than like a rule — and it was a rule, and the rule was wrong.
 *
 * The rule now is one sentence: **a reminder is announced only if it became due after the scheduler
 * started.** What came due while the app was closed is missed rather than replayed, which is the same
 * answer the schedule already gives a slot it slept through.
 *
 * The clock is injected, so "what does the scheduler do at this moment?" is a question the test can
 * ask rather than a question the test has to wait for.
 *
 * Nothing here is anchored to the day it was written on, and nothing here is anchored to the zone
 * the reader's computer happens to be in: the prayers are calculated for a fixed day in UTC, and the
 * queue's slots are wall-clock hours on a winter's day, so the fixture answers the same question in
 * Ramallah as it does in a build agent in Frankfurt. The two schedules are kept apart as well — the
 * queue tests silence the bells, and the prayer tests leave the queue off — so that a prayer landing
 * on the same minute cannot turn a statement about the scheduler into a statement about the calendar.
