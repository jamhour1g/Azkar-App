/**
 * The persisted form of the presentation settings, asserted through the same encoder the repository
 * uses.
 *
 * This exists because nothing else could have caught the bug it exists to catch. The class carries a
 * `private companion object` for its bounds, the serialization plugin puts the generated serializer
 * outside the class, and the first encode at runtime failed with an `IllegalAccessError` on
 * `Companion` — after compilation succeeded, after every other test passed, and only once a person
 * actually moved a switch in the manager. A round trip through `Json` is the cheapest thing that can
 * prove the access is legal, so it is a test rather than a note in the code.
 *
 * The `Json` configuration is duplicated deliberately: mirroring it is what makes the failure mode
 * reproducible here, and a test that used a laxer configuration than production would prove less.
