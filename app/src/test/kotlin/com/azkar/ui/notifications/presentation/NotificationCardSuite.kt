/**
 * What the user can actually do with a card, asserted through the semantics tree.
 *
 * The presenter suite covers what the card *is*; this covers what it *does*, which is the half a
 * headless unit test cannot reach because it needs the pointer and the composition: that the whole
 * body is one target that opens Azkar, that the cross is a separate target that dismisses, and that
 * every label on the card is translated — an untranslated accessibility label in the Arabic build is
 * a real defect, and the one thing here that has to be checked against a resource rather than
 * against a callback.
 *
 * The card used to carry considerably more than this, and most of these cases are the absence of
 * something: there is no title beside the passage, no translation of it, no citation, no grade, no
 * collection name, no tags and no other controls. Those absences are the feature — a reminder is a
 * glance, and a card about a passage has to be read past to reach the passage — so they are asserted
 * rather than merely left out of the fixtures. A fixture that could not produce them would prove
 * nothing.
 *
 * The one control that came back is the star, and the cases below are about it rather than about its
 * absence: whether it is offered at all, whether it keeps the passage it belongs to, and what it
 * does when the write behind it fails. The rest of the card's economy is unchanged, and the gesture
 * count is asserted as a count so that anything else added back is caught even if it is a control
 * this test has never heard of.
 *
 * Three bodies are covered because the card draws three: a passage, a prayer time, and the
 * payload-less notice the proof-of-concept harness still publishes. The last of those is why the
 * old title-and-message assertions stayed rather than being replaced — a caller that has not been
 * updated must still draw something legible, and that is only a promise if it is asserted.
 *
 * Every case goes through [cardTest], which owns the frame and the theme, so what a test states is
 * what it is about and not the scaffolding around it. The frame is the **default preset's** size
 * rather than something generous: the card fills whatever box it is given and ellipsizes when the
 * passage does not fit, so a test that hands it a tall frame is testing a card that most readers
 * will never see.
