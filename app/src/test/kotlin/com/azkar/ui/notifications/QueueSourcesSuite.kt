/**
 * Which passages the queue can draw from, and in what order.
 *
 * The order is the part worth pinning. The queue used to recite in an order the user arranged
 * somewhere else entirely, and the library showed a different order again — so the same app could
 * promise one thing and do another. These are the rules that make the shelf's order the queue's
 * order, and the rules that make a passage picked on its own a source like any other.
