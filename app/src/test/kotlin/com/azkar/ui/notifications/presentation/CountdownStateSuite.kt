 * The rule the bar along a card's top edge follows.
 *
 * The bar is the only part of a reminder card that says how long the card intends to stay, so it has
 * to be a clock and not a decoration. A clock runs one way, and the rule that keeps it running one
 * way is the whole of what this suite is about: the bar keeps the smallest fraction it has been told
 * and refuses a reading that would put time back on it.
