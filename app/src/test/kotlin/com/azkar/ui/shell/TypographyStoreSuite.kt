/**
 * That a reader's face and size are still there on the next launch, and that a value this build
 * cannot honour is turned into one it can rather than thrown at the theme.
 *
 * The face half is the one with a real failure mode and it is not a crash: a settings file that
 * travels to a machine without the chosen face installed would otherwise leave the theme asking for
 * a family that does not resolve. [TypographyStore.read] answering with a usable value is what keeps
 * that a cosmetic problem, and the only way to test it is to write a name this machine does not have
 * — which is what `putStoredFamily` exists for.
 *
 * The round trip goes through a second reader over the same settings rather than a copy of the
 * file. The question being asked is "does the choice come back?", and the in-memory store answers it
 * in full; whether a value survives a restart on disk is asked once, in
 * [com.azkar.settings.SettingsStoreSuite].
