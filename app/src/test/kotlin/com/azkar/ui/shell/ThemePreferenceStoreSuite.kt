/**
 * The stored colour preference, and the rules that govern a stored value nobody can honour.
 *
 * This is the fix for a toggle that changed the palette and forgot: `selectTheme` moved the state
 * and never wrote it, and nothing read the key back, so the next launch always opened following the
 * system.
 *
 * The round trip is asserted through a second reader over the same settings rather than through a
 * copy of a file. The question being asked here is "does the choice come back?", and the in-memory
 * store answers it in full: it holds the same bytes a file would, and the store under test writes
 * them through the same code. The question that *is* about the disk — does a value survive a
 * restart, and what happens when the file is corrupt — has its own home, in
 * [com.azkar.settings.SettingsStoreSuite], and is asked there.
