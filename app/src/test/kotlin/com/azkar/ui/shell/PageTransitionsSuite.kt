/**
 * The direction the shell's page transitions travel in.
 *
 * Nothing about a transition can be checked by looking at a screenshot — `AnimatedContent` does not
 * animate its first composition, so the still the harness captures is the same with or without any
 * of this, and the desktop `NavDisplay` shipped a hard cut before it, which is exactly why nobody
 * noticed. The sign is also the one piece of this that is genuinely easy to get wrong twice: it is
 * derived from a boolean in one place and a layout direction in another, and a page that slides the
 * wrong way reads as a bug rather than as an effect.
