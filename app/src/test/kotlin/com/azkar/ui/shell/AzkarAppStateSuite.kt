/**
 * Switching the application language.
 *
 * The invariant worth protecting is that the two copies of the active language cannot drift:
 * `org.jetbrains.compose.resources` reads the JVM default, while the tree recomposes off
 * [AzkarAppState.locale]. Nothing derives one from the other, so a change that updates only one of
 * them would leave the window titled in one language and drawn in another, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * [AzkarAppState] takes its persistence as a constructor argument precisely so these can assert on
 * the write without touching the real `settings.preferences_pb`.
