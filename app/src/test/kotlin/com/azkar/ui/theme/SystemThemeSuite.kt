 * The parsers behind [readSystemTheme].

 * The reading of a real desktop is a subprocess and two files on disk, so it is the parsing that
 * deserves pinning down: what GNOME prints, what Plasma and GTK write, and the one value that means
 * "no preference" rather than "light". That last one is the trap — treating `'default'` as light
 * would silently contradict a desktop that is dark through some other route.
