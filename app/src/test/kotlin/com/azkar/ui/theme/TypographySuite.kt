 * That the face picker is describing this machine rather than the one the app was written on.
 *
 * The picker exposes the complete family catalogue derived at runtime from AWT. These assertions are
 * about the relationship between the two lists, not about any particular family being present on the
 * machine that happens to be running the test.
 *
 * `SCALE_STEPS` is asserted separately because the slider is built from it: a step list that no
 * longer spans the clamped range produces a thumb that cannot reach either end, which is not a crash
 * and so nothing else would notice.
