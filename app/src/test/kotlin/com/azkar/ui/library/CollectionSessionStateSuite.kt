/**
 * The session screen's rules, exercised against the fake gateway.
 *
 * The rules worth pinning down here are all about a position that is never stored: which passage is on
 * screen after a tap, what "skip" means at the end of a shelf, and that the counts roll back when the
 * write fails. A stored cursor would pass most of these by construction, which is exactly why they are
 * worth writing down.
