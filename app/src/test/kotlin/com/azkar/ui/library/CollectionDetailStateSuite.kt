/**
 * The collection detail page's member grid: what it shows, and in what order.
 *
 * The grid grew a sort and a view of its own, and both of them are claims the page makes to the reader
 * about twenty-nine passages at once, which is the hardest kind of claim to keep. The rules worth
 * pinning down here are therefore the ones that cannot be seen in any single screenshot: that a
 * position on a card is a position in the *collection* and not in whatever the grid is currently
 * showing, and that a sort is a view of the collection rather than a rewrite of it.
 *
 * There is no longer a filter axis here. It had one — a row of category chips — and the rules it
 * needed were three of the five above. What it bought was a second way to hide a passage from a
 * reader who came here to read passages, on a page whose only two remaining controls are ones that
 * change the shape of the whole grid. A "by category" *order* survives, because ordering the members
 * under the headings they already carry is not the same act as showing only one of them.
