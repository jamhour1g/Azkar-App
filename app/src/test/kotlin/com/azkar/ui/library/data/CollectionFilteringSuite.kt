/**
 * Which collections the hub shows, in what order, and what its search box reaches.
 *
 * These are rules a screen cannot be trusted to hold on its own. Two of them in particular are
 * decisions rather than consequences: that a pinned collection stays at the top whatever sort is
 * chosen, and that a cross-collection hit is reported once per collection rather than once per
 * remembrance. Both are easy to "simplify" later into something that looks equivalent and is not.

/**
 * Searching and sorting a shelf that has been translated.
 *
 * These are the same two rules as above — the query reaches the words on the card, and the name sort
 * puts them in order — applied to a shelf whose words differ by language. They need pinning because
 * the obvious implementation reads one string, and the translations are a map beside it: a query for
 * "أذكار" would find nothing, and a name sort would order the shelf by whatever language it happened
 * to be typed in. Both look correct in English and fail silently in Arabic.
