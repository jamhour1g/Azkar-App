 * A collection cover is a file the app copied into its own directory, and two links stand between
 * the stored name and the pixels on a shelf card: the cache has to resolve the name to a file, and
 * the art has to hand that file to the image loader.
 *
 * The second link is the one that was broken. `CollectionCard` defaulted its `covers` argument to
 * `null` and the shelf never passed it, so every card resolved its own cover to nothing and painted
 * the generated wash instead -- a collection could be created with a picture, the picture could sit
 * on disk and in the database, and the shelf would never show it. These tests cover the default
 * itself rather than the symptom, and they pair the two cases that have to stay opposite: a cover
 * that resolves reaches the screen, and one that does not leaves the wash behind rather than a
 * hole in the grid.
