/**
 * That the row above the members still says everything it is responsible for saying, and still offers
 * everything it is responsible for offering.
 *
 * This row has been rewritten three times in one sitting and every rewrite moved something between the
 * band, this row, and a card of their own. It carried the category chips; when those came out their `⋯`
 * menu's two actions became icon buttons here. Then progress, which used to be a bordered card between
 * this row and the members, moved onto this row, and the two view toggles were joined into one control.
 * Then the sort picker, which was an `OutlinedTextField` with a floor on its height and so stood at
 * nearly twice the height of everything beside it, was redrawn at the row's own size. The questions
 * below are the ones that move with those changes rather than the ones that were always true: that
 * progress is on the row, that the two view options are one control rather than two buttons, that the
 * sort is the same height as its neighbours, and that the reset is *absent* rather than inert when
 * there is nothing to undo.
 *
 * The joined toggle is the interesting one. "Are these two buttons?" is not a question any assertion
 * about presence can answer — both options were present before and both are present now, and the
 * difference is the four pixels of air between them. So it is asked as geometry: the two labels must
 * be separated by the seam and nothing else. A future change that takes the seam out and puts the
 * ordinary gap back fails here even though every node is still on the row. The sort height is the same
 * kind of question and is answered the same way, against the control beside it rather than against a
 * number copied out of the component.
 *
 * The absence assertions matter for the same reason [HeroLayoutSuite] exists for the band: a control
 * that is present but wrong is invisible to every other test in the app.
