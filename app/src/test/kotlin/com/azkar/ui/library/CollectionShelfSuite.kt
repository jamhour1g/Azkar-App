 * The shelf's grid arithmetic.

 * The grid used to be a `LazyVerticalGrid`, which worked out its own columns and its own height. It
 * is now a plain grid inside a column that scrolls, so it has to work both out for itself, and this
 * is the arithmetic it does — the same arithmetic the collection's members are laid out with, which
 * is why the narrowest cell is a parameter here rather than a constant of this file's.
