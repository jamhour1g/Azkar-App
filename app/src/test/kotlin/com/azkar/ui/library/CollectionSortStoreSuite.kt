/**
 * The stored order of the library.
 *
 * The shelf's sort is a choice the user makes once and expects to keep, the same way the colour
 * preference is: a shelf that reopened on a different order every launch would make the "My order"
 * sort — the one the queue recites in — a thing that has to be re-chosen every morning.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the disk. What is being asked is how the order is *chosen and remembered*,
 * not whether a byte reached a file, and the in-memory store answers that question without the file
 * IO that would put a filesystem between the test and the thing it is testing. A round trip is a
 * second reader over the same settings rather than a copy of a file: the in-memory store has no
 * one-instance-per-file rule, so there is nothing to copy.
