/**
 * The order the user gives the shelf, and what the shelf does with it afterwards.
 *
 * Two things are pinned down here, and they are the two that used to disagree. The order a drag
 * writes is the order the shelf then shows — the user has just told the library which order they
 * want, and a sort that threw that away would throw it away the moment the page recomposed. And
 * that order is the one the reminder queue recites in, which is why the custom order does not hoist
 * a pinned card out of it: two different orders for the same shelf is how the app ends up promising
 * one thing and doing another.
